# Changelog

What changed in each release of Kimochi, newest first. Written for the people who use the app:
what they can now do, what behaves differently, what was fixed. The app shows this file in
**What's new** (and once, on its own, after it has updated), and the version's section becomes
the GitHub release's notes, so keep it readable.

Add lines under **Unreleased** as you merge work; `npm run release -- <version>` moves them under
the new version with the date. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Headings inside a version are optional: `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`.

## [Unreleased]

- Steam Deck: the welcome guide can add Kimochi to your Steam library, with its own artwork, so you
  can start it from Gaming Mode alongside your game. Settings → General has the same button.
- Linux: Kimochi now shows up under Education in your apps menu, with a description.
- Linux: dictionaries with AVIF images, such as Jitendex, now import on every distribution,
  Steam Deck included, instead of failing with "Could not load image".
