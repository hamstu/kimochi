# Changelog

What changed in each release of Kimochi, newest first. Written for the people who use the app:
what they can now do, what behaves differently, what was fixed. The app shows this file in
**What's new** (and once, on its own, after it has updated), and the version's section becomes
the GitHub release's notes, so keep it readable.

Add lines under **Unreleased** as you merge work; `npm run release -- <version>` moves them under
the new version with the date. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Headings inside a version are optional: `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`.

## [Unreleased]

- Shortcuts can now use **Insert** alone or with Shift, as well as a function key. Windows and Linux also support **Pause** and **Scroll Lock**. Handy for visual novels, where a shortcut with Ctrl makes the game skip text.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-28

### Added

- **Much faster Manga OCR.** This model will now run faster with a compatible GPU, and it's even improved when it falls back to CPU only.
- **Debug info for bug reports.** Settings → About → Debug info has a **Copy** button that puts a report on your clipboard. **Save debug bundle** saves the same report with recent logs as a zip. **Verbose logging** records extra detail while you reproduce a problem.

### Changed

- Kimochi uses far less CPU on the Steam Deck and other Linux PCs.
- "Built-in Yomitan" is renamed to just **Yomitan** ("Runs inside Kimochi").
- Clearer OCR engine descriptions in the welcome guide and Settings

### Fixed

- MeikiOCR on Windows should recognize text correctly again
- Steam Deck: Fixed a whole bunch of compatibility and performance issues with Steam Deck.
- Sentence audio recording works on Linux AppImages, including Steam Deck, instead of stopping with a PipeWire error.
- Kimochi's own windows can be screenshotted and screen-recorded again (Snipping Tool, ShareX and so on). Only the OCR overlay and dictionary pop-ups stay hidden from captures.
- The welcome guide no longer loses Jitendex's download and import progress when you switch windows or steps.
- Switching dictionary engine while Jitendex is importing waits for the import to finish instead of interrupting it.
- Yomitan settings no longer get stuck loading on some Windows machines; if startup does stall, a Retry button appears.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-27

- First alpha release of Kimochi.
